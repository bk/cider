# Cider

**Cider** is a simple, elegant and responsive [wmk](https://github.com/bk/wmk) theme for product sites.
It is based upon the Zola theme [Juice](https://juice.huhu.io/) by [Huhu.io](https://huhu.io), which has been adopted by [several product sites](https://juice.huhu.io/showcases/).

# wmk

[wmk](https://github.com/bk/wmk) is a flexible and featureful static site generator written in Python.
Its default templating system is [Mako](https://www.makotemplates.org/), but this theme uses [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) instead.
